In vim selecting and editing is one step. This can be done with the gn text-object. Normally you will search for a word you want to change and the change the next found occurrence with cgn once and then use vimâ€™s most powerful command the . (dot). Using . you can apply the change to the next word or skip one word with n which will jump to the next word
